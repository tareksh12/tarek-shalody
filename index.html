      	    <h2>Permanent Observers</h2>
        	  <h7>The Hunger Artist</h7>: The interest in hunger artists has declined in recent decades. At a time when organizing great shows for such art in the old days was used by the organizers with huge amounts of money, it has become impossible today. Those days were completely different, as the hunger artist captured the attention of the entire city. The numbers of the audience were increasing day after day, the longer the artist spent his fasting.</p>
             <p class="op">Everyone wanted to see the artist of hunger at least once a day. In the final days of the show, tickets are sold as spectators spend all day sitting in front of the bars of a small cage. In fact, there were performances at night hours that used torches to light in order to increase their impact on the audience. On days when the weather is mild, the cage is pulled out to be placed in the open air.</p>
             <p>For adults, the hunger artist was often just a laughing show, a show they have watched because it was a mainstream tradition. As for the children, they looked at the show with amazement, their mouths were empty, holding each other's hands for more safety, as the hunger artist sat there on scattered straw - disdainful to sit on a chair - he wears a tight black robe, it looks pale, and his ribs appear prominent, or he shakes His head is politely sometimes, answering questions with an artificial smile, but extending his arms out of the cage bars to let people see how much his body was thin, but he then returned to drown in the depths of himself, so that he does not pay attention to anything, and does not even care what was so important According to him, it is the watch ticking, which is the only piece of furniture in the cage, almost He looked in front of him almost Magaflten eyes, and sipped a dose of water from a small bowl occasionally for wetting his lips.</p>

    	       <p>Besides casual onlookers there were also relays of permanent watchers selected by the public, usually 
               butchers, strangely enough, and it was their task to watch the hunger artist day and night, three of them 
               at a time, in case he should have some secret recourse to nourishment. This was nothing but a formality, 
               instigated to reassure the masses, for the initiates knew well enough that during his fast the artist would never in any circumstances, not even under forcible compulsion, swallow the smallest morsel of food; the honor of his profession forbade it. Not every watcher, of course, was capable of understanding this, 
               there were often groups of night watchers who were very lax in carrying out thei</p> 
               <h3>Duties and deliberately 
               huddled together in a retired corner to play cards with great absorption</h3>
                <p> obviously intending to give the 
               hunger artist the chance of a little refreshment, which they supposed he would   draw from some private 
               hoard. Nothing annoyed the artist more than these watchers; they made him miserable; they made his fast 
               seem unendurable; sometimes he mastered his feebleness sufficiently to sing during their watch for as long 
               as he could keep going, to show them how unjust their suspicions were. But that was of little use; they 
               only wondered at his cleverness in being able to fill his mouth even while singing. Much more to his taste 
               were the watchers who sat close up to the bars, who were not content with the dim night lighting of the 
               hall but focused him in the full glare of the electric pocket torch given them by the impresario. The harsh 
               light did not trouble him at all, in any case he could never sleep properly, and he could always drowse a 
               little, whatever the light, at any hour, even when the hall was thronged with noisy onlookers.</p> 
                
               <p class="kj"> Of course there were people who argued that this breakfast was an  unfair attempt to bribe the 
               watchers, but that was going rather too far, and when they were invited to take on a night’s vigil without a 
               breakfast, merely for the sake of the cause, they made themselves scarce, although they stuck stubbornly 
               to their suspicions. <p>

            <p class="point">Brod could not summon much surprise at this instruction. He knew all too well that Kafka did not think highly of what he called his “scribbling.</p>” <p>Kafka’s diaries are steeped both in the preoccupation with what he calls Schriftstellersein, being-a-writer, and in self-slandering laments at how “dead” and “inert” he found what he terms his “feeble literary work.” Take, for example, his diary entry of March 13, 1915:<p>

            <p>bLack of appetite, fear of getting back late in the evening; but above all the thought that I wrote nothing yesterday, that I keep getting farther and farther from it, and am in danger of losing everything I have laboriously achieved these past six months. Provided proof of this by writing one and a half wretched pages of a new story that I have already decided to discard . . .<p>

            
            <p class="number">In 1917</p>
            <h5> In the last months of his life, Dora Diamant said “he wanted to burn everything that he had written in order to free his soul from these ‘ghosts.’ I respected his wish, and when he lay ill, I burnt things of his before his eyes.”<h5>

            Kafka here tempts us to speculation: can his last instruction to Brod be understood as a characteristic gesture of a literary artist whose life was a judgment against itself? As a self-condemnation, with Kafka acting as both judge and the accused?<p>

      	    <p>Immediately after Kafka’s death, Brod set out to write what he called “a living work of art” to resurrect his beloved friend. “Above all,” he said of his next novel, “I wanted to bring him to life for myself in this new way. So long as I lived in this book, in working at it, he was not dead, he still lived with me.”<p>

            <p class="novel">In the novel, a roman à clef called The Kingdom of Love (Zauberreich der Liebe, 1928, English edition 1930), Kafka appears in the thin disguise of Richard Garta, a tall, delicate man who wished to live “in complete austerity.” Garta radiated both a “delicate sadness” and “a powerful, imperceptible, but irresistible force,” Brod writes. “He did not speak to disciples, to the people, like Buddha, Jesus, or Moses. He remained shut within himself. But that was perhaps because he saw further into the great secret than they had done.”</p>


            <p>Nowy cannot reconcile himself to Garta’s death. “His utter integrity,” Nowy says,“marvelous as it was, led to nothing. I warned him, I struggled to save him. There is no doubt—he died of his devotion to perfection.” Nowy “had taken charge of all Garta’s literary remains, as, indeed, Garta had requested him to do, with the proviso that they should all be destroyed.”<p>

           
            <p>Nowy, like his author, defies the request, “in view of the inestimable value he attached to Garta’s writings.” Nowy says that Garta “made the ultimate demands on himself; as he had failed, his writings, that were but steps that exalted height, had no value for him. He, indeed, but he alone, had the right to despise them in this way.” Nowy decides to keep Garta’s papers in his safe, having concluded “that in our time the Saint could only show himself thus incompletely.”<p>

            
            <p>In the novel’s closing scene, the brother reveals that Garta had not only confessed the desire to settle in Palestine (a Zionist who never physically made it to Zion), but had left at his death a mass of manuscripts in Hebrew—“as much as in German.” Nowy resolves to return to Europe to edit his friend’s posthumous papers.<p>

            <p5>Beset by a guilty conscience, Brod used his fiction to seek Kafka’s blessing from beyond the grave.<p5>

      	<p>Unable to save his friend in life, Nowy endeavors to save Garta in death. To orchestrate the “fight for the spiritual legacy of his dead friend,” he boards a steamer to Palestine to find Garta’s younger brother, a pioneer living in a Communist settlement in the Jezreel Valley near Mount Gilboa, “a noble example of that integrity which Garta had so worshiped.” “Kafka’s fundamental attitude,” Brod writes elsewhere, “was that of the chalutz, the pioneer.” In 1918, Kafka had sketched his vision of frugal life in a socialist kibbutz in a piece called “Workers without Possessions,” envisioning a diet of bread, water, and dates. “Any existing possessions should be given to the state for the construction of hospitals homes,” Kafka wrote.<p>
